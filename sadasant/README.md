Hello guys.

Well... I thought on making the "same core" of calls to both of the
rendering options we're going to make (css and canvas), that core should be
"roids.js". I put some comments in roids.js, I'll fill others with time...

**What is done:**

*  It shows a triangle in the center of the screen.
*  It rotates with the left-right keys.

**What should be done soon:**

*  The rent is too damn high (it's consuming a lot of processing).

**Mini-examples:**

* [Rotating a triangle with canvas](http://jsfiddle.net/sadasant/3sBRh/4/)

I guess that's it :D

\m/ Long live to *jsve*!
