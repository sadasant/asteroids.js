Hello guys.

Well... I thought on making the "same core" of calls to both of the
rendering options we're going to make (css and canvas), that core should be
"roids.js". I put some comments in roids.js, I'll fill others with time...

**What is done**:
* It shows a triangle in the center of the screen!

**What should be done soon**
* Rotations of the triangle with the left-right keys.

I guess that's it :D

\m/ Long live to *jsve*!
